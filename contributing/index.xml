      <description>If you want to contribute to the documentation, that is awesome! Your help is very much appreciated, but please do keep in mind the instructions below.
Prerequisites These documentation pages are built with Hugo and we do make some assumptions:
 You have Git 2.5 or greater installed on your machine. You have a GitHub account. Signing up for GitHub is free. You have Hugo installed on your machine.  In Hugo, pages are the core of your site.</description>
