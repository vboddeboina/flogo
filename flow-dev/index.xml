      <description>As of Flogo 0.5.0, a Flow is more inline with the concept of a function, that is, a Flow has both input and output parameters. In this section we&amp;rsquo;ll analyze what this means and how to map data between triggers and flows.
Why? The concept pf decoupling a trigger from a flow is a key part of supporting multiple triggers and re-use/sharing of a flow. A Flow can now operate against the data that it has defined within its declartion, it otherwords, just like a function, the scope of data that a Flow can operate against must reside within either the Flow context (or as an environment variable).</description>

      <description>On this page we&amp;rsquo;ll analyze the different types of mappings available to you as a Flow developer.
What are mappings? A mapping in a Flogo Flow can be used to assign the value of a variable to that of an input parameters of an activity or to the value of another flow scoped variable.
Types of mappings If you peak under the covers, you&amp;rsquo;ll note that we have a number of different mapping types supported in the Flogo engine.</description>
